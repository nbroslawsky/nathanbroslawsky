										li ...aided in the transition from Associated Content (www.associatedcontent.com) to the Yahoo! Contributor Network (contributor.yahoo.com) and Yahoo! Voices (voices.yahoo.com).
										li ...ran detailed SQL reports for editors and contributors to better understand the effects (and ultimately payments) of different types of content across different Yahoo! verticals, including Yahoo! Sports, Yahoo! News, and many others.
										li ...led the team responsible for internationalizing and localizing the Yahoo! Contributor Network for the launch in the UK and Brazil. This project was planned, scoped, and completed in a 9-month period in 2011. The project also required the hiring and management of a short-term team of contractors to help with the externalization of text and implementation of a new MVC framework.
										li ...coordinate with other teams within Yahoo! to enhance and develop internal APIs and components, primarily around globalization and debugging.
